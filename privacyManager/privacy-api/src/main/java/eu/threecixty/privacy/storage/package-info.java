<p> Provides mechanisms for controlling the access to semantically annotated 
    personal information. Data access is regulated using user policies 
    which can be described using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XACML">XACML</a> 
    documents. Having a formal semantics specified for the stored resources 
    leads to greater assurance that the attached policies are not misinterpreted and 
    still provides the flexibility and adaptability required for such a generic 
    storage system.</p>
