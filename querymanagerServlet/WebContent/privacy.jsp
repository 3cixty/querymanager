						users, compile statistics and ultimately improve the services we
						offer you.</li>
					<li>We store and process the following data, which you have stored at 
					    Facebook or Google, depending on the login option you have used.

					    will only function if the approximate location of your device is 
						identified on the basis of the localization data (GPS) transmitted by 
						your device. This location data is used to personalize the available

				<span class="tag-desc"></span>
				<p class="privacy-desc">You hereby agree that your above-mentioned data are stored and used each time you use our services.</p>
				<br>
				<h3 class="privacy-title">Right of Revocation</h3>
				<span class="tag-desc"></span>
				<p class="privacy-desc">You can revoke your consent for your
					personal data to be collected and stored by 3cixty at any time. If

				<h3 class="privacy-title">Cookies, Google Analytics and Social
					Plugins</h3>
				<span class="tag-desc"></span>
				<h4 class="privacy-subtitle">1. Cookies and Google Analytics</h4>
				<p class="privacy-desc">We use Google Analytics, a web analytics
					service provided by Google Inc. (&ldquo;Google&rdquo;). Google
					Analytics uses &ldquo;cookies&rdquo;, text files which are stored
					on your computer and enable analysis of how you use the website as
					well as user recognition, both to ensure that users are not
					required to re-authenticate themselves upon each visit and for
					statistical analysis purposes. The information generated by the
					cookie regarding your use of this 3cixty is transmitted to a Google
					server, where it is stored. Google will use this information to
					analyze your use of the website, compile reports regarding website
					activities for the website operator, and provide additional
					services associated with use of the website and the internet.
					Google may also pass this information on to third parties if
					required by law or where said third parties are processing the data
					on behalf of Google. By using our services, you are giving your
					consent for the data collected about you by Google as described
					above to be processed for the aforementioned purposes. You can also
					prohibit the capture of the data related to your use of the website
					generated by the cookie (including your IP address) by Google and
					the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing
					the <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=us">browser plug-in</a>.
					</p>
				<h4 class="privacy-subtitle">2. Social Plugins</h4>
				<ul class="privacy-desc">
					<li><h5>a. Facebook and Facebook Connect</h5>
						<p class="privacy-desc">We use &ldquo;social plugins&rdquo;
							from Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304,
							USA (hereinafter &ldquo;Facebook&rdquo;). These can be identified
							by the Facebook logo, a textual reference to Facebook, or the
							description <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/">&ldquo;Facebook Social Plugin&rdquo;</a>. If you access
							one of our service pages containing such a plugin, a direct
							connection will be established with Facebook via your browser,
							transmitted to your browser, and included in 3cixty. The plugin
							will also inform Facebook that your browser was used to access
							the relevant 3cixty page. If you are logged in to 3cixty and
							Facebook simultaneously, Facebook will be able to allocate your
							3cixty visit to your Facebook account and establish a connection
							not limited to the actual access of the website itself. If you
							make active use of the plugin, for example by clicking the
							&ldquo;Like&rdquo; button or leaving a comment, this will also be
							transmitted to Facebook and stored there via the plugin. Details
							of the scope and purpose of Facebook&#039;s data collection,
							processing, and use can be found in Facebook&#039;s privacy
							policy. This also contains tips for protecting your privacy. If
							you do not consent to the aforementioned transfer of data to
							Facebook through using our services and wish to prevent it from
							happening, please log out of Facebook before you access 3cixty.</p>
						<p class="privacy-desc">Facebook Connect is a service provided
							by Facebook, Inc. This function enables you to authenticate
							yourself on 3cixty using your Facebook profile, meaning that no
							additional registration is required. If you use Facebook Connect,
							Facebook is granted access to certain elements of your personal
							data, in particular your email address and other
							information about your visit to 3cixty. Facebook also stores this
							data in countries not within the EU, for example the USA. 3cixty
							is conversely granted access to your publically accessible
							Facebook profile data. If you do not wish to allow this, you
							should not use Facebook Connect, in which case you can log in
							using Google+. There is no option to log in via a separate login
							function. Please note that you can also use 3cixty without
							logging in, but certain functions (wish list) will be
							unavailable. Further details are available in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/full_data_use_policy">Facebook&#039;s data policy</a>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li><h5>b. Twitter</h5>
						<p class="privacy-desc">3cixty also uses the microblogging
							service Twitter. This function is provided by Twitter, Inc. (1355
							Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA). By using
							Twitter and the &ldquo;retweet&rdquo; function, you are linking
							the web pages you visit to your Twitter account and disclosing
							them to other users. Data is also transmitted to Twitter. The
							purpose and scope of Twitter&#039;s data collection and their
							further processing and use of data, as well as the associated
							rights and setting options for protecting the privacy of users,
							can be found in Twitter’s privacy policy under <a href="https://twitter.com/privacy">https://twitter.com/privacy</a>.
							You can change your privacy settings with Twitter in the account 
+						settings at: <a href="http://twitter.com/account/change_settings">http://twitter.com/account/change_settings</a>.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li><h5>c. Google+</h5>
						<p class="privacy-desc">We use the Google+ button of the social
							network &ldquo;Google+&rdquo;. This social network is operated by
							Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043,
							USA. The Google+ button can be identified by the &ldquo;g+&rdquo;
							symbol. If you access our service pages containing a Google+
							button, in your browser this will establish a direct link with the
							Google servers from where the button will be loaded. In doing so,
							Google Inc. is informed that the relevant service page was
							accessed. The content of the &ldquo;g+&rdquo; button is provided
							directly to your browser and integrated into the website by
							Google. We therefore have no control over the scope of the data
							collected by Google using the button. If you are a member of
							Google+ and do not want Google to collect data about our website,
							you must log out of Google+ before you access our web pages.</p>
						<p class="privacy-desc">Google+ Connect is a service provided
							by Google+, Inc. This function enables you to authenticate
							yourself on 3cixty using your Google+ profile, meaning that no
							additional registration is required. If you use Google+ Connect,
							Google+ is granted access to your personal data, in particular
							your encrypted email address and other information about your
							visit to 3cixty. Google+ also stores this data in countries not
							within the EU, for example the USA. 3cixty is conversely granted
							access to your publically accessible Google+ profile data. If you
							do not wish to allow this, you can log in using Facebook. There is
							no option to log in via a separate login function. Please note
							that you can also use 3cixty without logging in, but certain
							functions (wish list) will be unavailable. Details of which
							specific data Google collects for its own purposes and information
							about further data processing and use are available in
							<a href="https://developers.google.com/+/web/buttons-policy">Google&#039;s privacy policy</a>.
