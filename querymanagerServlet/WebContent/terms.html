				<h3 class="privacy-title">App creation</h3>
				<span class="tag-desc"></span>
				<p class="privacy-desc">3cixty retains the right to block or delete apps that have been created by Users and that 3cixty considers

				rights then the corresponding User will exempt 3cixty from these claims. In such cases 3cixty is also entitled to issue stored 
				information to the claimant in order to prevent own use. The exemption obligation also includes the payment of reasonable legal 
				costs incurred by 3cixty. If you are affected by this kind of infringement you can send it to us directly to the relevant department

No guarantee and/or compensation claims can be made on the basis of such failures. The cure period for 3cixty in the event of other guarantee claims is 20 days after the claim for defect by the User against 3cixty. The User is entitled to further legal rights once this period has passed without resolution.</li>
